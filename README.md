Modular Planning and Tracking Framework (FaSTrack-Inspired)

This repository implements a RRT* planner for safe and efficient path generation in cluttered environments.
The simulation demonstrates how a robot explores the environment to find an optimal path while avoiding obstacles.

ðŸ§© Features:

2D environment simulation

Sampling-based RRT* algorithm

Visualization of tree expansion

Path smoothing and obstacle avoidance
